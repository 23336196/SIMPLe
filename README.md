# SIMPLe: Safe, Interactive Movement Primitives Learning

This is the code use for the experiements done for the paper: 
### Interactive Imitation Learning of Bimanual Movement Primitives 

published in ### Transaction of Mechatronics (T-MECH) ###

This repository was the official one used for the tests. 

I am still cleaning the code and making it as a python package.
